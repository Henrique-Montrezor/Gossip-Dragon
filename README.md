# Gossip Dragon üêâ  
#### Video Demo: <URL(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6n6l8RLziw)>  
#### Description:

**Gossip Dragon** is my final project for CS50, a playful command-line Python program that lets users interact with a dragon who loves collecting secrets. Behind the whimsical ASCII art of a dragon (powered by the `cowsay` library), the program uses an SQLite database to securely store, retrieve, update, and delete secrets shared by players.  

The idea behind Gossip Dragon was to mix something lighthearted and fun with practical programming concepts like databases, input validation, exception handling, and modular design. The result is a small but complete application where players can ‚Äúconfide‚Äù in the dragon, ask about other people, or even manage what the dragon remembers about them.

## How It Works  

When the program starts, the screen is cleared and the dragon greets the player by name. The player is then presented with a menu of options:

1. **Tell the Dragon a secret** ‚Äì Stores a new secret (linked to the player‚Äôs name) in the database.  
2. **Ask about another person** ‚Äì Retrieves a random secret associated with another player.  
3. **Update one of your secrets** ‚Äì Lets the player choose an existing secret of theirs and replace it with a new one.  
4. **Ask the Dragon to forget a secret** ‚Äì Deletes one of the player‚Äôs secrets from the database.  
5. **Quit** ‚Äì Exits the program.  

Each interaction is decorated with fun ASCII dragon messages generated by `cowsay`, making the experience feel more like a conversation with a character than a plain database app.

## Project Structure  

The entire project resides in a single file (`project.py`) but is divided into logical sections for clarity:

- **`User` class**  
  Handles player information. When instantiated, it asks for the player‚Äôs name and stores it for use in the game.  

- **Database functions**  
  - `connect_sql()` ‚Äî Connects to the SQLite database and returns the connection and cursor.  
  - `create_table()` ‚Äî Ensures the `dragon_secrets` table exists.  
  - `insert_value()` ‚Äî Inserts a new secret for a given player.  
  - `get_secret()` ‚Äî Retrieves a random secret belonging to another player.  
  - `update_player_secret()` ‚Äî Allows a player to update one of their previously stored secrets.  
  - `delete_secret()` ‚Äî Lets a player delete one of their secrets.  

- **`interface()`**  
  Presents the main menu, reads user input, and calls the corresponding functions.  

- **`main()`**  
  Orchestrates the program: clears the terminal, sets up the database, launches the interface, and ensures the connection is closed properly.

## Design Choices  

- **SQLite Database**: Chosen because it is lightweight, requires no external server, and integrates well with Python. Perfect for small-scale projects like this.  
- **Cowsay Dragon Output**: Adds personality to the program, making it fun and engaging instead of a dry database app.  
- **Input Validation**: Multiple loops and try/except blocks ensure that invalid inputs (like typing letters where numbers are expected) do not crash the program.  
- **CRUD Operations**: All four fundamental database operations are represented: Create (insert secrets), Read (get secrets), Update, and Delete.

## Testing  

I tested the program by:  
- Entering multiple players and verifying that secrets were correctly linked to names.  
- Attempting invalid inputs (letters instead of numbers, choosing out-of-range menu options) to confirm graceful error handling.  
- Updating and deleting secrets to ensure database changes persisted as expected.  
- Running on both Windows and Unix environments to validate the screen-clearing and database functionality.

## Future Improvements  

- **Encryption**: Currently, secrets are stored in plain text. A future improvement would be to encrypt them before storing.  
- **More Interactivity**: Adding mini-games or challenges before revealing secrets.  
- **Web or GUI version**: Extending Gossip Dragon beyond the terminal to a simple web app or graphical interface.  
- **Multiplayer session**: Allowing two players to interact with the dragon in real time.

## Conclusion  

Gossip Dragon is more than just a quirky idea‚Äîit demonstrates database integration, user interaction, and modular programming in Python. While the dragon makes the experience lighthearted, the underlying code covers serious CS50 concepts like persistent storage, error handling, and program structure. It‚Äôs a project I‚Äôm proud of, and one that can easily be expanded with new features in the future.
